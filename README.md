# Unity-Wizard-2D-Platformer
A 2D platformer about a Wizard. Many assets missing as the project is too large and this is just to show my coding.

All C# was writeen by me with a few modified scripts from other coders. 
My code includes: 
* Character movement and interaction
* NPCs, friendly and enemys
* AI
* Weapons
* Abilities
* Pick ups
* Interactive objects 
* Day/night cycle
* Death and respawn
* UI
* Menus
* Timers
* Score system
* Cash system

  I also did all the art work in Photoshop and animations in Adobe Animate.
